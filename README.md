# FLASK API

This is a bare minimum REST API made using Python and Flask.

If you are on Linux or WSL;

- create a virual environment

``` bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

- activate the virtual env

``` bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

- Install the dependancies listed in the requirements.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Run the tests to see if the API is working. I used `Thunder Client` for testing.
